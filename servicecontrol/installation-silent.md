### Silent Installation Options

Note:  This documentation covers silent installation instructions for ServiceControl Version 1.7 or greater.


#### Silent installation from the commandline

The following command line will silently install the ServiceControl Management utility only.

```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet
``` 

Instances of the ServiceControl service can be deleted, added or upgraded via the Utility.


#### Silently Add ServiceControl during installation 

The following command line will silently install the ServiceControl Management and a ServiceControl instance.

```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet /LV* install.log UNATTENDEDFILE=unattendfile.xml
```

For details on how to make the `unattendedfile.xml` file refer to ServiceControl Management [PowerShell](installation-powershell.md) documentation.
The installed instance will use `localsystem` as the service account. To specify an alternative service account use the `SERVICEACCOUNT` and `PASSWORD` command line switches.

```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet /LV* install.log UNATTENDEDFILE=unattendfile.xml SERVICEACCOUNT=MyServiceAccount PASSWORD=MyPassword
```


#### Silently Upgrade ServiceControl during installation

If an existing service matching the name specified in the unattended XML file already exists the unattended install option is ignored. 
To update one or more instances of ServiceControl as part of the silent installation the command line switch `UPGRADEINSTANCES` command line argument can be used. 
 

In this example we've chosen to silently install the ServiceControl Management utility and attempt to upgrade all the installed instances of the ServiceControl service. Either `*` or  `ALL` can be used to specify all instances should be upgraded.


```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet /LV* install.log UPGRADEINSTANCES=ALL

``` 

In this example we've chosen to silently install the ServiceControl Management utility and attempt to upgrade just one instance called `TestServiceControl`.

```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet /LV* install.log UPGRADEINSTANCES=TestServiceControl
``` 

To specify multiple instances use a comma separated list: 

```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet /LV* install.log UPGRADEINSTANCES=TestServiceControl,ProdServiceControl 
``` 


#### Add the license file as part of the Silent installation

In this example we've chosen to silently install the ServiceControl Management Utility and import the license file.

```bat
Particular.ServiceControl.1.7.0.exe /quiet /LV* install.log LICENSEFILE=license.xml
```


#### Combining command line options

It is valid to combine the `LICENSEFILE`, `UNATTENDEDFILE`, `UPGRADEINSTANCES`,  `SERVICEACCOUNT` and `PASSWORD` options on the same command line.
The `SERVICEACCOUNT` and `PASSWORD` only apply to a new instance, these values are not used on upgrades.


#### Command line Uninstall

The following command can be used to uninstall ServiceControl Management Utility silently:

```bat
wmic product where (name like '%servicecontrol%') call uninstall
```

NOTE: This command will not remove any ServiceControl service instances that are currently deployed.

 
#### Logging and Failures
In each of the samples above a log file was specified on the command line. The silent install actions will log to the MSI log file specified. In versions prior to 1.7 if an installation action failed the installation was rolled back, this resulted in failed upgrades acting like a complete uninstall of the product. From 1.7 a failure to do an unattended install action will be logged but the overall installation will still return success and not rollback.

#### PowerShell

All of the actions that can be carried out as unattended installation action are also available via the [ServiceControl Management PowerShell](installation-powershell.md)    


#### Setting configuration entries not covered in the unattended file

The unattended file does not cover all the settings available to customize the operation of the ServiceControl service.
The following PowerShell script shows a simple way to script the modification of some of the optional configuration settings. The provided script makes use of the ServiceControl Management PowerShell module shipped with v1.7 to find the configuration file locations.


Prior to using the script modify the `$customSettings` hash table to reflect the key/value pairs you wish to set.
The provided entries in the `$customSettings` hash table are to illustrate how to set the values and are not meant to be a recommendation on the values for these settings.

```powershell
#Requires -Version 3
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator

Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Configuration
Import-Module 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Particular Software\ServiceControl Management\ServiceControlMgmt.psd1'

$customSettings = @{
    'ServiceControl/HeartbeatGracePeriod'='00:01:30'  
}

foreach ($sc in Get-ServiceControlInstances)
{
	$exe = Join-Path $sc.InstallPath -ChildPath 'servicecontrol.exe'
    $configManager = [System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager]::OpenExeConfiguration($exe)
	$appSettings = $configManager.AppSettings.Settings
	foreach ($key in $customSettings.Keys)
	{
	   $appSettings.Remove($key)
	   $appSettings.Add((New-Object System.Configuration.KeyValueConfigurationElement($key, $customSettings[$key])))
	}                 
	$configManager.Save()
	Restart-Service $sc.Name
}

```
